# ZeroDivisionError in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: improper handling of zero values in division operations. The `myFunction` attempts division, but fails to correctly handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero, which leads to unexpected results or errors. The solution demonstrates how to use proper error handling to improve code robustness.
